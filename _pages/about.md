I am a Ph.D. Candidate at [Database Technologies and Data Analytics](http://www.dbda.cs.uni-frankfurt.de/) lab in Goethe University Frankfurt, where I am advised by Prof. Lena Wiese.

Before starting my Ph.D. I worked as a Software Test Engineer in large-scale enterprises ([Dotin](https://www.dotin.ir/en/), [Snappfood](https://snappfood.ir/)) in Iran. I did my Bachelors and Masters in Computer Software Engineering at Alzahra University and Dr. Shariati Vocational and Technical Girls College.

Research Interest
======
I am interested in the analysis of encrypted genomic data (like gene expression data) by state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms with Homomorphic Encryption.
