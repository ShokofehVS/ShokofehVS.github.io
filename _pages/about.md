I am a computer science engineer with recent experience in genomic privacy and forensic watermarking. My training encompasses data science, large-scale biomedical data analytics, proficiency in machine learning algorithms, and expertise in the Python programming language. With an overall +3 years, I have held roles as a test engineer and business analyst within enterprises specializing in software development for the banking sector and digital video markets.


<!--Research Interest
======
I am a Ph.D. Candidate at [Database Technologies and Data Analytics](http://www.dbda.cs.uni-frankfurt.de/) lab at Goethe University Frankfurt, where I am advised by Prof. Lena Wiese. I am interested in the analysis of encrypted genomic data (like gene expression data) by state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms with advanced cryptography techniques. -->
